# Real-time Global Localization for LIV-SLAM Using Referenced Image

## Introduction
RGL-LIV-SLAM proposed a real-time global localization method which only relies on a Lidar-initial-visual SLAM (LIV-SLAM) and a referenced image
The proposed method enables long-range navigation without requiring GPS or loop closure, while eliminating accumulated localization errors.

An example on NCLT dataset squence 2012-02-04 is shown below:

## Indoor Scene Comparison

The effect of the proposed algorithm with and without OAGS in an indoor scene is shown below:
